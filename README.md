# Iconographer
> Facial recognition icon-maker for fandom nerds

## Usage
* `Open`: Choose a folder of images to make icons from
* `Output`: Choose a folder for icons to go into
* `Known Images`: Choose a folder of already-identified images. This is optional but allows the program to organize icons by actor/character. Folder and icon names will match to the known image name (eg a known image of `James_Kirk.jpg` will create the folder `James_Kirk` containing the relevant icons). Unrecognized images go into `unknown`.
* `Icon Size`: Final size for icons
